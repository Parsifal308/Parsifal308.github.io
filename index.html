										<h2 class="major">About me.</h2>
										<p>I am a passionate video game developer with two years of experience in the industry. During my career, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting projects.</p>
										<p>My passion and experience are focused on designing engaging gameplay that not only entertains players, but also serves as an effective means to achieve game objectives. I believe in the importance of maintaining harmony between the game mechanics and its narrative, thus avoiding ludonarrative dissonance that can affect the player's immersion.</p>
										<p>Outside of work, I enjoy spending time outdoors, engaging in sports and gaming. I also dedicate time to crafting stories that fuel my creativity.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Skills</h2>
										<p>I have extensive programming experience in languages such as C#, C++, Java, and Python, primarily within Unity Engine and Unreal Engine environments. Additionally, I am proficient in using essential development tools such as Git for version control, Postman for API testing, and communication platforms like Discord and Slack for effective team collaboration.</p>
										<p>Blender, ZBrush, Substance Painter, and GIMP are my go-to tools for 3D asset creation. With these, I model, texture, and edit assets, delivering high-quality results.</p>
										<p>I have experience coordinating small teams and tasks, ensuring projects are completed efficiently. Through clear communication and organization, I facilitate teamwork, delegate effectively, and maximize productivity.</p>
